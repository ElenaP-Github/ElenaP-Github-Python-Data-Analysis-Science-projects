- Customer Retention Analysis(II):

Given a Database I analyzed how long two different customer groups were using a online service.
     - Churn: binary variable. Whether the customer left or not the online service
     - Tenure: the number of months. The cases are filtered by this variable fom 0 months to 72 months.
     - SeniorCitizen: binary category, I decided to rename it as "Subscription". 0 for Subscription Standard and 1 for Subscription Premium
