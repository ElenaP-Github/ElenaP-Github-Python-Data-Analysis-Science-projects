- Car insurance project: A profit and loss analysis 

Given a data case with 20 car insurance companies values. I had to explain the total ganancies of them during one year.

    Have the entrepreneurs had more in damage than in deposit?
    Can certain effects be predicted?
    Does the number of damages have something to do with the damage behavior.

- Customer Retention Analysis(II):

Given a Database I analyzed how long two different customer groups were using a online service.
     - Churn: binary variable. Whether the customer left or not the online service
     - Tenure: the number of months. The cases are filtered by this variable fom 0 months to 72 months.
     - SeniorCitizen: binary category, I decided to rename it as "Subscription". 0 for Subscription Standard and 1 for Subscription Premium
